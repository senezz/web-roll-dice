            The game “Roll Dice” is for 2–4 players and has 7 rounds. The goal is to score more points than your opponents. In each round, players take turns rolling two dice, add up the numbers, and write the result in a table. After the seventh round, everyone totals their points. The player with the highest score wins. If there’s a tie, you can play an extra round to decide the winner.
